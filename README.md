# rock-paper-scissors
The Odin Project foundations project where I create a game of rock, paper, scissors which is played within the console.

Add shadows around the choices after each round
    green for human, red for computer, orange for a tie
    e.g. 
    if human === rock && computer === scissors
        rock.style.textShadow = "etc"
